This app is aimed at small store owners who wish to maintain an inventory of store items in their Android phones.

The app has a simplistic user interface which allows users to record and update their inventory on the fly.

The app implements features which make it possible to store information in a SQLite database, integrate Android's file storage system with the database, retrieve and present information from the database, and allow the database to be udpated with new user information.
