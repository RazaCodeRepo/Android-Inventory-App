This app is aimed at small store owners who wish to maintain an inventory of their store items in their Android phones.
The app has a simplistic user interface and allows the users to record and update their inventory on the fly.
The app implements features which make it possible to store information in SQLite database, integrate Android's file storage system in that database, retrieve and present information from the file system and database, and allow the database to be udpated with new user information.
